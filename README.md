# Programming challenge

This is a programming challenge given by Wildlife. The challenge consists in 5 iterations.

I used Python 3 on my MacBook Pro with macOS Catalina V10.15.5. In order to test the Port Scanners, I used a virtual machine with Metasploitable 2 and my localhost.

All the iterations will allow you to enter the host name or the IP address and validate it. Then it will let you know if it's using threads or not. Also, I checked for the correct ammount of aguments and the program usage will display on the terminal too. I also wrote the code to show the Closed ports just in case, but it is commented. 

## Iteration 1
This is a simple port scanner. For this iteration, I used the modules sys, socket and termcolor. 

Usage of the program:
```
$ iteration1.py <target host>
```

## Iteration 2
This is a port scanner that uses threads in order to optimize the work. You can specify the number of thread with the optional flag -t otherwise it will use 5 by default. For this iteration I used the modules sys, socket, threading, optparse, queue and termcolor.

Usage of the program:
```
$ iteration2.py [-t <threads>] <target host>
``` 

## Iteration 3
This port scanner allows you to decide if you want to use threads or not. Threads are used by default, if you use the flag -f the threads will not be used, even if you specified them.

Usage of the program:
```
$ iteration3.py [-t <threads>] [-f] -H <target host>
``` 

## Iteration 4
This port scanner is very simmilar to the last one, but it will also tell you if the open port is a HTTP server. 

Usage of the program:
```
$ iteration4.py [-t <threads>] [-f] -H <target host>
``` 

This is a demo of the results when running the Port Scanner with Metasploitable 2 as Host target

## Iteration 5
For this iteration a dockerized the Port Scanner from Iteration 4. 

Usage of the program:
```
$ docker run wildlife:latest [-t <threads>] [-f] -H <target host>
``` 



Notes: for some reason I experienced some problems running the last docker image, but this didn't happen before when I tried with the first iterations. I believe it is a local problem, I started experiencing this issues when I updated pip. I will solve this and update the code if necessary. 



Thanks ! :)
